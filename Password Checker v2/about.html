<h1>About Us</h1>
<h4>Eli, Kayden, Daniel, Ashton</h4>
<p>We are students in the cybersecurity program at the Davis Catalyst Center, where we explore ethical hacking and learn how to secure programs, services, and servers against potential threats. This password checker started as a somewhat spontaneous group project to help  people better protect themselves by strengthening one of the most commonly used security measures online.</p>
